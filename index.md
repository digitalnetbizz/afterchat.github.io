## Welcome to AfterChat Product Page

AfterChat is a chat and mini-game app that work without the Internet. It helps connect people nearby who are connected to the same Wifi network or Device hotspot. This means whether you are in situation without Internet such as camping, in a flight, road trip, you can still chat and play a game together. 


### How it works

No login is needed because there's no servers. App connects to each other and work together. There are 2 modes of connection.

- Wifi mode (devices are connected to the same Wifi such as school, library or home)
- Hotspot mode (devices are connected to the same device hotspot when Wifi network in not available)

Wifi mode is preferred as it requires no setup (just make sure devices are connected to the same Wifi network).

All messages are encrypted and there's no privacy issue as no message are kept in the servers or app.

### Getting Started

When you first launch the app, you are required to give a handle name to identify you (for eg. GoodUser1)
